    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Healthy Chicken and Rice Casserole combines brown rice with broccoli and chicken- no canned soup in sight!
        Instead, use yogurt for a lighter yet still wonderfully creamy chicken broccoli rice casserole! Best of all,
        this recipe uses just 10 ingredients, one pan, and practically just minutes of hands-on prep!</p>
