    <h1>Pan Seared Steak Recipe</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I love the kind of dinner that you can cook without a recipe. The truth is, good cooking is more about technique
        than recipes and the best dishes are often the simplest to prepare. A properly cooked steak is case in point.
        With just a few ingredients and a single pan, you can cook a steak that's as delicious as one you'd order in a
        high-end steakhouse.</p>

    <p>The key is knowing how to pan-sear. Pan-searing is a classic technique in which the surface of the food is cooked
        undisturbed in a very hot pan until a crisp, golden-brown, flavorful crust forms. It's the key to building
        flavor and texture in a dish. It also prevents sticking and gives your food a restaurant-quality look.
        Pan-searing is the absolute best way to cook a steak (salmon, too), and it also happens to be the easiest.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (12-oz) New York strip or ribeye steaks or 4 (6-oz) filet mignons, about 1½ inches thick</li>
        <li>1 heaping teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>A few sprigs fresh thyme leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To begin, pat the steaks dry with paper towels.</li>
        <li>Season the steaks all over with the salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Turn on your exhaust fan and heat a heavy pan (preferably cast iron or stainless steel) over medium-high
            heat until it's VERY hot. </li>
        <li>Add the oil to the pan and heat until it begins to shimmer and move fluidly around the pan.</li>
        <li>Carefully set the steaks in the pan, releasing them away from you so the oil doesn't splatter in your
            direction. The oil should sizzle.</li>
        <li>Leave the steaks alone! Avoid the temptation to peek or fiddle or flip repeatedly; the steaks need a few
            minutes undisturbed to develop a golden crust. Flip the steaks when they release easily and the bottom is a
            deep-brown color, about 3 minutes. Continue to cook the steaks for another 3 to 4 minutes on the second side
            for rare to medium-rare. (For medium, cook 4 to 5 minutes on second side; for well-done, cook 5 to 6 minutes
            on second side). </li>
        <li>During the last minute of cooking, add the butter and thyme sprigs to the pan with the steaks.</li>
        <li>If you are serving the steaks unsliced, transfer them to plates and serve hot. If you plan to slice the
            steaks, transfer them to a cutting board and let rest, covered with aluminum foil, for 5 to 10 minutes; then
            slice thinly against the grain. </li>
    </ol>
